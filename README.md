# Pear Deck Development Hiring Screening Challenge

## The goal

We're looking for great developers (who isn't?).  After about 20 interviews we realized we could save a lot of time
for us and for you by running through a little coding exercise before setting up an interview.

Your time is valuable.  This challenge is designed to take a total of less than 15 minutes if you're already familiar
with javascript.  The test is written in coffeescript for brevity, but you won't need to write any yourself.

## Install

You need node, npm, and git first.  Then:

    git clone https://github.com/peardeck/pd-interview-screener.git
    cd pd-interview-screener
    npm install

## Run the tests

    npm test

## The goal

Implement the missing functions so that all of the tests pass!
